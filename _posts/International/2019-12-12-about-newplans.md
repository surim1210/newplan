Hi. I'm Surim working as a travel planner and activity recommender. I will make you the most unforgettable memory during your trip to Korea. Do you want to know Korea? Participate in many special classes and enjoy your trip! You can also make your own souvenirs. Make special memories of your life!! Here are a couple of things to do in Korea.

• One-day class program - making cooking, and art, making perfume, flower class, and more.

• Culture class program - making Korean foods, Tempele-stay, street food and more.

• Exercise class program - flying yoga, climbing, body correction.


If there's an activity that I'm interested in my posts, please leave a comment. And, if there is any activity you want to do, please tell me. I respect your opinion. Tell me your route and which day you want to put it in. I'll help you plan your trip more easily and easily.

Although I still have a small plan, I hope these little plans will be a small gift to you from afar.
