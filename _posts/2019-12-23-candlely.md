# Make a Natural Handmade Air Freshener.

Using natural ingredients to freshen the air in your home is a great way to absorb odors and create a nicely scented environment for your family.

__Let's make a 'Marine' air freshener!!__

#### Step 1. Decorate the diffuser vase.

You can fill diffuser vase up with various shells, coral reefs, 8 kinds of sand.

Tip!
- Coral reefs and grasses are hard to infix in the sand, so it is recommended to dig them around with tweezers.

#### Step2. Choose Your Scent.

There are more than 20 kinds of fragrance oil, and you pick the one you want.

Tip!
- I recommend you to pick the strong fragrance because the strong scent is better to spread in the air.

- If you keep smelling scent, you can get a headache. So, If you have any fragrance you like, I recommend listing them in front of you. And then, Take it again.
