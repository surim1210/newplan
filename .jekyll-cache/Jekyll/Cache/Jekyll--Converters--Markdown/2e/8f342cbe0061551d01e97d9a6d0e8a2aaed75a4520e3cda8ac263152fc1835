<p>The first thing to take care of when you travel is the passport. Normally, we need to take off the passport cover at the screening, but this passport case is durable that can be easily put in and out so I chose to use it. From now on, I will introduce three places that can do three things at once a day from the museum to the workshop experience.</p>

<p>This is the “SIMone Handbag Museum!”</p>

<p>The ticket booth and museum is on the third floor, so don’t enter the store as soon as you get in and let’s take the elevator to the third floor. 5000 won only includes admission to the museum; so if you want to experience leather art, let’s get a day pass!!</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/02/ticket.JPG" alt="ticket" /></p>

<p>A day ticket includes the museum pass, one free drink, and leather art experiences. Due to the drying leather process at the leather art, there are two ways to go to the museum and cafe first, take out coffee, and go to the museum using the time when leather edge dries. Why can’t you go to the museum without going to the cafe? The reason is that the museum is not allowed to bring food into the museum.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/02/pass&amp;card.JPG" alt="pass" /></p>

<p>I chose the first way and experienced the leather workshop first, and when I first went, I chose the passport case and the card wallet, which is my choice of taste. There were many kinds of leather, and you can choose what you want to do. When I went there were only those leathers, and every day I went there seemed to be a little different leather. If you’ve made all your choices, you’re ready!</p>

<p>The first thing we did was to squeeze the leather into the shape of a passport case because it was square! The thing to be careful when we squeezed is to cut it with a force at once.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/02/cut.JPG" alt="cut" /></p>

<p>If all are cut, the next process is the edge coat, which is to paint the cut cross section with a knife to prevent the end of the leather from spreading. It is folded in half, so it only paints the upper side. If it is a side, it can be fixed and painted.</p>

<p>After the edge coat is dry, you can choose the color (sweet-edge paint) to wear on the edge; I have a sample, so I think it would be nice to choose it when I compare it to my work. I chose the opposite because the color was dark, because I thought I could find it if it was dark in the bag, and I chose the best-flipper mustard color. I think it’s okay.</p>

<p>The side should be attached to the bond and fixed with the thread. This process is set for the workshop experience time, so the workshop captain directly gives it to you.</p>

<p>It is then said that it is better to paint a little thicker than the upper surface because it is doubled to have to paint the side edge and bottom side which are not painted again with edge coat and edge paint. I went to the museum while the edge paint was dry.</p>

<p>The museum consists of two floors, and each floor has a different feeling. The third floor is avant-garde, so it feels modern, while the fourth floor is Victorian, and there is an audio guide, so let’s rent it if you need it!</p>

<p>I went to the cafe and had a drink and waited a little while, so it seemed that it was time to dry the edge paint, so I went back down again. I’d made it with leather for the first time, but I was happy to see the finished product.</p>

<p>I had a variety of experiences at a low price for the blog theme. It was made up of a good composition from museum to leather craft at a price of 32,000 won, so I could see, hear and feel leather.</p>
