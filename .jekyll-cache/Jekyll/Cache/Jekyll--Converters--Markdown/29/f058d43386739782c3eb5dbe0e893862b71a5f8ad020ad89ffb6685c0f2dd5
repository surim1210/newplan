<p>The first thing to take care of when you travel is the passport. Normally, we need to take off the passport cover at the screening, but this passport case is durable that can be easily put in and out so I chose to use it. From now on, I will introduce three places that can do three things at once a day from the museum to the workshop experience.</p>

<p>This is the “SIMone Handbag Museum!”</p>

<p>The ticket booth and museum is on the third floor, so don’t enter the store as soon as you get in and let’s take the elevator to the third floor. 5000 won only includes admission to the museum; so if you want to experience leather art, let’s get a day pass!!</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/02/ticket.JPG" alt="ticket" /></p>

<p>A day ticket includes the museum pass, one free drink, and leather art experiences. Due to the drying leather process at the leather art, there are two ways to go to the museum and cafe first, take out coffee, and go to the museum using the time when leather edge dries. Why can’t you go to the museum without going to the cafe? The reason is that the museum is not allowed to bring food into the museum.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/02/pass&amp;card.JPG" alt="pass" /></p>

<p>I chose the first way and experienced leather art first. When I first went there, it was a choice of passport cover and card wallet, which is a preference. Next is leather selection. There were many kinds of leather, and you can choose from them what you want to do. There were only those leather skins when I went there, and I think there were slightly different leather skins every day. Once you’ve made your choice, you’re ready! Let’s go back to work.</p>

<p>The first thing we did was because the leather is square, so let’s cut it into the passport cover shape frame! You have to be careful when you squeeze things out. You have to cut them with all the strength to make them look pretty.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/02/cut.JPG" alt="cut" /></p>

<p>Once you finish cutting, the next process is the edge coating, which is applied to the cut section with a knife to prevent the tip of the leather from spreading. It folds in half, so only coat the top part. For the side part, it has to be stapled with thread and color it.</p>

<p>After the edge coating is completed, you can choose the color (edge paint) to put on the corners. I think it would be better to compare the samples to my work. I chose the opposite color because mine was dark. Because it’s dark inside the bag, and I thought I could find it if the top was bright, so I chose the mustard color that makes it stand out well. I think it’s pretty fine.</p>

<p>The side should be attached to the bond and fixed with the thread. This process is set for the workshop experience time, so the workshop captain directly gives it to you.</p>

<p>It is then said that it is better to paint a little thicker than the upper surface because it is doubled to have to paint the side edge and bottom side which are not painted again with edge coat and edge paint. I went to the museum while the edge paint was dry.</p>

<p>The museum consists of two floors, and each floor has a different feeling. The third floor is avant-garde, so it feels modern, while the fourth floor is Victorian, and there is an audio guide, so let’s rent it if you need it!</p>

<p>I went to the cafe and had a drink and waited a little while, so it seemed that it was time to dry the edge paint, so I went back down again. I’d made it with leather for the first time, but I was happy to see the finished product.</p>

<p>I had a variety of experiences at a low price for the blog theme. It was made up of a good composition from museum to leather craft at a price of 32,000 won, so I could see, hear and feel leather.</p>
