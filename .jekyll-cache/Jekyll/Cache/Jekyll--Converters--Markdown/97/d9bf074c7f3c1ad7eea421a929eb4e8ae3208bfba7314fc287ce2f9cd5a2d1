<p>The first thing to take care of when traveling is the passport. Usually, when you have a passport wallet, you have to take your wallet off the search desk and take it out, but the passport case you are going to make now is in the form of putting your passport and taking it out immediately. From now on, I will introduce three places a day from museum to workshop experience.</p>

<p>Ticket booths and museums are on the third floor, so do not go into the store as soon as you enter, but take the elevator to the third floor. 5,000 won includes only the entrance fee of the museum. If you want to experience leather crafts from the museum admission ticket, let‚Äôs break the one-day pass!</p>

<p>One-day tickets include museum viewing, a free one-drink drink, and a leather workshop experience. In the case of leather workshop, there are two ways to experience the dyes first because there is time to dry, then take out the coffee and take out the coffee and visit the museum using the time when the leather edge is dry. Why can‚Äôt you go to a museum if you visit a cafe? Because it‚Äôs a food ban area in a museum.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/02/pass&amp;card.JPG" alt="pass" /></p>

<p>I chose the first way and experienced the leather workshop first, and when I first went, I chose the passport case and the card wallet, which is my choice of taste. There were many kinds of leather, and you can choose what you want to do. When I went there were only those leathers, and every day I went there seemed to be a little different leather. If you‚Äôve made all your choices, you‚Äôre ready!</p>

<p>The first thing we did was to squeeze the leather into the shape of a passport case because it was square! The thing to be careful when we squeezed is to cut it with a force at once.</p>

<p><img src="/img/post/02/cut.JPG" alt="cut" /></p>

<p>If all are cut, the next process is the edge coat, which is to paint the cut cross section with a knife to prevent the end of the leather from spreading. It is folded in half, so it only paints the upper side. If it is a side, it can be fixed and painted.</p>

<p>After the edge coat is dry, you can choose the color (sweet-edge paint) to wear on the edge; I have a sample, so I think it would be nice to choose it when I compare it to my work. I chose the opposite because the color was dark, because I thought I could find it if it was dark in the bag, and I chose the best-flipper mustard color. I think it‚Äôs okay.</p>

<p>The side should be attached to the bond and fixed with the thread. This process is set for the workshop experience time, so the workshop captain directly gives it to you.</p>

<p>It is then said that it is better to paint a little thicker than the upper surface because it is doubled to have to paint the side edge and bottom side which are not painted again with edge coat and edge paint. I went to the museum while the edge paint was dry.</p>

<p>The museum consists of two floors, and each floor has a different feeling. The third floor is avant-garde, so it feels modern, while the fourth floor is Victorian, and there is an audio guide, so let‚Äôs rent it if you need it!</p>

<p>I went to the cafe and had a drink and waited a little while, so it seemed that it was time to dry the edge paint, so I went back down again. I‚Äôd made it with leather for the first time, but I was happy to see the finished product.</p>

<p>I had a variety of experiences at a low price for the blog theme. It was made up of a good composition from museum to leather craft at a price of 32,000 won, so I could see, hear and feel leather.</p>
